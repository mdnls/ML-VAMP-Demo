# ML-VAMP Demo for CNNs

A demo implementation of Multi-Layer Approximate Message Passing applied to a trained generative neural network. The algorithm is introduced by [Pandit et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03409.pdf) and their original implementation is [here](https://github.com/GAMPTeam/vampyre). 

This implementation is written in Pytorch and it supports generative networks using Conv2D, Upsample (bilinear upsampling), ReLU, and Tanh layers.
